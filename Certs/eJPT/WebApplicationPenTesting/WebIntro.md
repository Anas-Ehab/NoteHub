# Websites
* Websites are files on a server.
* Mostly HTTP & CSS & Js.

## HTTP Protocol 
* HTTP Protocol is used to access these files
* Headers: hold information about what you are requesting.
* Methods:
  - GET: Retrieve a file.
  - HEAD: Get the headers (no content).
  - POST: Send data.
  - PUT: Putting files.
  - DELETE: Deleting files.
  - CONNECT: Not super common.
  - OPTIONS: Checks which of these methods are avaliable.
  - TRACE: Not super common.
  - PATCH: Not super common.
* Directory: What you are requesting (the files).
* Host: it's the host that you are trying to access.
* User-agent: The browser you are using to make the request.
* Request is what you send for the server.
* Response is what you get back from the server.
  - Responses have status code (i.e. 200 Sucessful/ 404 Not Found...)
* Browsers interpret and process web data.
* Sessions aren't maintained by HTTP itself. Instead they utilize cookies to maintain a session.
* HTTPS is the encrypted version of HTTP.
