# Information Gathering
* The first step of a penetration test.
* Two types:
  - Active: Gathering as much information as possible by actively interacting with the target. 
  - Passive: Gathering as much information as possible without actively interacting with the target.
 
* What we are looking for:
  1. Passive:
    - IP addresses & DNS information
    - Domain name and domain ownership information
    - Email addresses & social media profiles
    - Web technologies used on the target
    - Subdomains

  2. Active:
     - Open ports on the target systems
     - The internal structure of the target's network/organization
     - Enumerating information from the target system
