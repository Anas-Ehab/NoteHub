# File & Resources Exploitation

## Arbitrary File Upload
* An arbitrary file upload vulnerability is a type of security flaw in web applications that allows an attacker to upload and execute malicious files on a web server.
* First enumerate the target to find the directory where the uploaded files go.
* After finding the directory check if it's publicly accessible.
* Bypassing extension restrictions:
  - Try changing the file type in the request without changing the content type. (In Ngix shell.jpg/shell.php will run the jpg file as PHP)

* Bypassing PHPx Blacklists
  - It's when you bypassed the uploading restriction but now facing restrictions when running the PHP file. (You know when the file is read as text file)
  - The restriction is done on the version of PHP so to bypass it change the extension from .php to .php5, .php6, .php7, etc..

## Directory Traversal
* Directory traversal vulnerabilities, also known as path traversal or directory climbing vulnerabilities, are a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a web application allows unauthorized access to files and directories outside the intended or authorized directory structure.
* Append "../" multiple times to traverse several levels up in the directory structure. (../ works on Linux for Windows there are different payloads)
* Check if you can traverse through the directories and if you can add ../ until you reach the root folder from there you can access sensitive files like */etc/passwd* or */var/log/*

## File Inclusion (FI)
* File inclusion in web applications refers to the practice of including external files, often scripts or templates, into a web page dynamically. It is a fundamental concept used to create dynamic and modular web applications.

### Local File Inclusion (LFI)
* Local File Inclusion (LFI) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application allows an attacker to include files on the server through the web browser.
* It can be found in
  - File Inclusion Functions: Functions like *include()*, *require()*, or *file_get_contents()* that accept user-controlled input for file paths.
  - HTTP Parameters: Input fields in web forms or query parameters in URLs.
  - Cookies: If an application uses cookies to determine the file to include.
  - Session Variables: If session data can be manipulated to control file inclusion.

### Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
* A Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability is a type of security flaw found in web applications that allows an attacker to include and execute remote files on a web server.
