# File & Resources Exploitation

## Arbitrary File Upload
* An arbitrary file upload vulnerability is a type of security flaw in web applications that allows an attacker to upload and execute malicious files on a web server.
* First enumerate the target to find the directory where the uploaded files go.
* After finding the directory check if it's publicly accessible.
* Bypassing extension restrictions:
  - Try changing the file type in the request without changing the content type. (In Ngix shell.jpg/shell.php will run the jpg file as PHP)

* Bypassing PHPx Blacklists
  - It's when you bypassed the uploading restriction but now facing restrictions when running the PHP file. (You know when the file is read as text file)
  - The restriction is done on the version of PHP so to bypass it change the extension from .php to .php5, .php6, .php7, etc..
