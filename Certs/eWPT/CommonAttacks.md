# Common Attacks

## HTTP Method Tempring
* It is a type of security vulnerability that can be exploited in web applications. It occurs when an attacker manipulates the HTTP request method used to interact with a web server.
* Test with options request to see what methods the request accepts.
* Try tampering the methods and test the results.

## Basic HTTP Authentication
* Basic HTTP authentication is a simple authentication mechanism used in web applications and services to restrict access to certain resources or functionalities.
* Credential Format: The client constructs a string in the format username:password and encodes it in Base64. It then includes this encoded string in an Authorization header in subsequent requests. ( Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz)
* How to test in Burp
  - Capture the authorization payload
  - Add password payloads
  - In payload processing add 2 rules
    1. Add prefix USERNAME: (i.e. admin)
    2. encode as base64
  - Run the attack
  - If you want to try different usernames you can utilize the cluster bomb attack type where you can use 2 payloads.
 * Hydra WWW Authentication 
##  HTTP Digest Authentication
* HTTP Digest Authentication is an authentication mechanism used in web applications and services to securely verify the identity of users or clients trying to access protected resources.
* Example: WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="Example", qop="auth", nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093", opaque="5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40e41"
* Elements:
  - realm: A descriptive string indicating the protection space (usually the name of the application or service).
  - qop (Quality of Protection): Specifies the quality of protection. Commonly set to "auth."
  - nonce: A unique string generated by the server for each request to prevent replay attacks.
  - opaque: An opaque value set by the server, which the client must return unchanged in the response.
  - Attack using hydra (*hydra -L USERNAMELIST -P PASSWDLIST URL/IP http-get /TARGETURI/*) (You can use lowercase l & p for only 1 username/password.)

## Sensitive Data Exposure
* Just enumerate any directories/file that are left unintentionally.


## Attacking Login Forms
* Using ZAP Fuzzer or Burp Intruder you can bruteforce.
* For OTP you can capture the OTP request and bruteforce it using the same technique.

## Session Management
* Session management in web applications refers to the process of securely handling and maintaining user sessions.
* Session Identifier: A unique token (often a session ID) is assigned to each user's session. This token is used to associate subsequent requests from the user with their session data.
* Session Data: Information related to the user's session, such as authentication status, user preferences, and temporary data, is stored on the server.
* Session Cookies: Session cookies are small pieces of data stored on the user's browser that contain the session ID. They are used to maintain state between the client and server.
* Attacks:
  - Session Fixation: Session fixation is a web application security attack where an attacker sets or fixes a user's session identifier (session token) to a known value of the attacker's choice.
  - Session Hijacking: Session hijacking, also known as session theft, is a security attack where an attacker illegitimately takes over a user's active session on a web application. 
  - Session ID Brute-Force: Attempt to brute force session IDs to assess their complexity and the application's resistance to such attacks.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery
* In a CSRF attack, the attacker crafts a malicious request and tricks a user into unknowingly sending that request to a vulnerable web application.
* The attacker lures the victim into loading this content while the victim is authenticated in the target web application.

## Command Injection
* Occurs when an attacker can manipulate the input fields of a web application in a way that allows them to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the underlying server.
* Look for an input field/endpoint where the input is run on the OS.

## PHP Code Injection 
* PHP code injection vulnerabilities, also known as PHP code execution vulnerabilities, occur when an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code within a web application.
* It's performed by malicious input: Attackers craft input that includes PHP code snippets, often enclosed within PHP tags (<?php ... ?>) or backticks (`)
* Look for an input field/endpoint where the input is handled by PHP.
