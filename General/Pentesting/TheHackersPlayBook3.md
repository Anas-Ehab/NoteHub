# Penetration Testing Teams vs Red Teams

* Penetration testing is the more rigorous and methodical testing of a network, application, hardware, etc.
* In short, you go through all the motions of Scoping, Intel Gathering, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Post Exploitation, and Reporting.
* The Red Team’s mission is to emulate the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) by adversaries.
* The goals are to give real world and hard facts on how a company will respond, find gaps within a security program, identify skill gaps within employees, and ultimately increase their security posture.
* For Red Teams, it is not as methodical as penetration tests.
* Another major difference in the scope is the timeline. With penetration tests, we are lucky to get two weeks, if not one. Whereas, Red Teams must build campaigns that last from 2 weeks to 6 months.
* Lastly, the largest difference is the outcome of the two types of teams. Instead of a list of vulnerabilities, Red Team findings need to be geared more toward gaps in blue team processes, policies, tools, and skills.
* The goal of the Red Team is to simulate real world events that we can track. Two strong metrics that evolve from these campaigns are Time To Detect (TTD) and Time To Mitigate (TTM).
  - Time To Detect (TTD): It is the time between the initial occurrence of the incident to when an analyst detects and starts working on the incident.
  - Time To Mitigate (TTM): This timeline is recorded when the firewall block, DNS sinkhole, or network isolation is implemented.
* As a Red Team, we don’t really care as much about the origins of an attack.

# The Tools
### Metasploit Framework
* Updated daily, has all of the latest public exploits, post exploitation modules, auxiliary modules, and more.

### Cobalt Strike
* It is a tool for post exploitation, lateral movement, staying hidden in the network, and exfiltration.
* Cobalt Strike doesn't really have exploits and isn't used for compromising a system via the newest 0-day vulnerability.
* Where you really see its extensive features and powers is when you already have code execution on a server or when it is used as part of a phishing campaign payload. Once you can execute a Cobalt Strike payload, it creates a Beacon connection back to the Command and Control server.
