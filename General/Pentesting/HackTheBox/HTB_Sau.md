* Scan the IP Address - *sudo nmap -n -Pn -p- IPADDRESS*
  - Port 22 which is open and service running on it is ssh
  - Port 80 which is filtered and service running on it is http
  - Port 55555 which is open and service running on it is unknown
  - Since, we do-not have any credentials or information related to our ssh opening, we can put it to rest in the back of our mind.
  - Port 80 is always our way-to-go but since nmap is marking it as being filtered . It is fair to conclude that we cannot communicate with it from outside until we have an help from within the network in which that service is running on.
  - Port 55555 seems to be our only way forward at this point.

* Open the website using any browser (*IPADDRESS:55555*)
  - When you open the browser you see the service running and its version. (*request-baskets v1.2.1*)
  - After doing some research you find that this version is vulnerable to SSRF (https://notes.sjtu.edu.cn/s/MUUhEymt7#).
  - Create a new basket and make it redirect you to the service running on port 80. (*127.0.0.1:80*)
  - Then access the basket (*IPADDRESS:55555/BasketName*)

* Check the new service (*IPADDRESS:55555/BasketName*)
  - When you open the browser you see the service running and its version. (*mailtrail v0.53*)
  - TBC
