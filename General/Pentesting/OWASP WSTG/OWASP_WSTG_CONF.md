* Fuzz for files with these extensions: *.asa .inc .config*

* The following files are directly downloaded when requested from a webserver so such files must not have any sensitive information
  - `.zip`, `.tar`, `.gz`, `.tgz`, `.rar`, etc.: (Compressed) archive files
  - `.java`: No reason to provide access to Java source files
  - `.txt`: Text files
  - `.pdf`: PDF documents
  - `.docx`, `.rtf`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, etc.: Office documents
  - `.bak`, `.old` and other extensions indicative of backup files (for example: `~` for Emacs backup files)

* File Uploads
  - file.phtml gets processed as PHP code.
  - FILE~1.PHT is served, but not processed by the PHP ISAPI handler.
  - shell.phPWND can be uploaded.
  - SHELL~1.PHP will be expanded and returned by the OS shell, then processed by the PHP ISAPI handler.
