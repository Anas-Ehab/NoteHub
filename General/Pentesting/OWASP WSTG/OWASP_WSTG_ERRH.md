# 08 Testing for Error Handling

## WSTG-ERRH-01 - Testing For Improper Error Handling
* Web Server
  - Search for random files and folders that will not be found (404s).
  - Try to request folders that exist and see the server behavior (403s, blank page, or directory listing).
  - Try sending a request that breaks the [HTTP RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231). One example would be to send a very large path, break the headers format, or change the HTTP version. (breaking the HTTP RFC may make the integrated web server show itself since it has to handle the request.)

* Applications
  1. Identify possible input points where the application is expecting data.
  2. Analyse the expected input type (strings, integers, JSON, XML, etc.).
  3. Fuzz every input point based on the previous steps
