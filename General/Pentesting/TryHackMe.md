## Introduction
* penetration testing is an authorised audit of a computer system's security and defences as agreed by the owners of the systems.


### Rules of Engagement (ROE)
* The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement.
* This document consists of three main sections, which are ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out.
  - Permission: This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.
  - Test Scope: This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.
  - Rules: The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay.

### Penetration Testing Methodologies
* The steps a penetration tester takes during an engagement is known as the methodology.
* The General Theme:
  - Information Gathering: This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research. (does not involve scanning any systems.)
  - Enumeration/Scanning: This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.
  - Exploitation: This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.
  - Privilege Escalation: Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).
  - Post-exploitation: This stage involves a few sub-stages:
      1. What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)
      2. What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user
      3. Covering your tracks
      4. Reporting

* The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)
  - The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems, applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:
    1. Telecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc.)
    2. Wired Networks
    3. Wireless communications

  - Pros:
    1. Covers various testing strategies in-depth.
    2. Includes testing strategies for specific targets (I.e. telecommunications and networking)
    3. The framework is flexible depending upon the organisation's needs.
     4. The framework is meant to set a standard for systems and applications, meaning that a universal methodology can be used in a penetration testing scenario.

   - Cons:
     1. The framework is difficult to understand, very detailed, and tends to use unique definitions.

* Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
  - Community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.
  - The foundation regularly writes reports stating the top ten security vulnerabilities a web application may have, the testing approach, and remediation.

  - Pros:
    1. Easy to pick up and understand.
    2. Actively maintained and is frequently updated.
    3. It covers all stages of an engagement: from testing to reporting and remediation.
    4. Specialises in web applications and services.

  - Cons:
    1. It may not be clear what type of vulnerability a web application has (they can often overlap).
    2. OWASP does not make suggestions to any specific software development life cycles.
    3. The framework doesn't hold any accreditation such as CHECK.

* NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1
  - Popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats.
  - The framework provides guidelines on security controls & benchmarks for success for organisations from critical infrastructure (power plants, etc.) all through to commercial.
  - There is a limited section on a standard guideline for the methodology a penetration tester should take.

  - Pros:
    1. The NIST Framework is estimated to be used by 50% of American organisations by 2020.
    2. The framework is extremely detailed in setting standards to help organisations mitigate the threat posed by cyber threats.
    3. The framework is very frequently updated.
    4. NIST provides accreditation for organisations that use this framework.
    5. The NIST framework is designed to be implemented alongside other frameworks.

  - Cons:
    1. NIST has many iterations of frameworks, so it may be difficult to decide which one applies to your organisation.
    2. The NIST framework has weak auditing policies, making it difficult to determine how a breach occurred.
    3. The framework does not consider cloud computing, which is quickly becoming increasingly popular for organisations.

  * NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF)
    - Extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences against these.
    - The framework applies to organisations considered to perform "vitally important services and activities" such as critical infrastructure, banking, and the likes.
    - Mainly focuses on:
      1. Data security
      2. System security
      3. Identity and access control
      4. Resiliency
      5. Monitoring
      6. Response and recovery planning

    - Pros:
      1. This framework is backed by a government cybersecurity agency.
      2. This framework provides accreditation.
      3. This framework covers fourteen principles which range from security to response.

    - Cons:
      1. The framework is still new in the industry, meaning that organisations haven't had much time to make the necessary changes to be suitable for it.
      2. The framework is based on principles and ideas and isn't as direct as having rules like some other frameworks.

### Types of Pen Testing
* Black Box: This testing process is a high-level process where the tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service.
* Grey Box: This testing process is the most popular for things such as penetration testing. It is a combination of both black-box and white-box testing processes.The tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software.
* White Box: This testing process is a low-level process usually done by a software developer who knows programming and application logic. The tester will be testing the internal components of the application or piece of software and, for example, ensuring that specific functions work correctly and within a reasonable amount of time.
