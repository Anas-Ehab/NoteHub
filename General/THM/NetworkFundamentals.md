# Network Fundamentals
* Networks are simply things connected.
* It can be only 2 devices or billions.
* The internet is the most hue network and it consists of smaller networks.
* A network can be either private or public.
* For a device to be a part of a network it needs 2 things, an IP address and a Medica Control Address
  - An Internet Protocol (IP) address is used to identify a host on a network.
    1. IPv4 contains 32 bits (4 octets) (i.e. 192.168.1.1)
    2. IPv6 contains of 128 bits
    3. An IP address can be private or public based on the address.

  - Media Access Control (MAC) is a unique address that is assigned at the factory the device was built at
    1. 12 hex decimal characters (i.e. a4\:c3:f0\:85\:ac:2d)
    2. The first 6 characters identify who built the interface and the last 6 are unique to the device
    3. MAC addresses can be faked/spoofed.
* Ping is one of the most fundamental network tools that's used to test connectivity between devices.
* the syntax is *ping IPADDRESS/URL*
